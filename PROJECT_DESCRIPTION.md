# Cat Butt Oracle - Interactive Ouija Board Art Installation

## Project Overview
An interactive art installation featuring a mechanical cat tail that points to letters and symbols on a custom ouija board. The piece explores the human experience of deciphering cat behavior and body language, presenting the tail's movements as mystical communication from beyond.

## Concept & User Experience
The installation presents cat tail movements as an oracle or contacted spirit. The tail acts as a ouija board planchette, moving precisely to letters on the board to spell out messages. This mirrors how humans constantly attempt to decode cat tail language in real life - the tail becomes a messenger pointing to specific locations with feline precision.

### Advanced Motion System (`tail_speller.py`)
**ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT FOCUS**: Sophisticated, lifelike tail movement for spelling messages:

#### Motion Philosophy
Creating organic, cat-like movements that feel alive rather than robotic. The tail should move with the deliberate precision of a cat placing its paw, complete with natural variations and timing.

#### Movement Architecture
**Three-Phase Motion Sequence:**
1. **Lift Phase**: Tail raises 4-6mm above board surface
2. **Approach Phase**: Simultaneous X/Y movement with organic variations
3. **Tap Phase**: Final 1-2mm with slight acceleration for cat-like "pounce"

#### Lifelike Motion Features
- **Waypoint Resolution**: 0.1mm spacing for ultra-smooth curves
- **Y-Axis Randomness**: Â±0.5mm variation during approach (journey varies, destination precise)
- **Speed Coordination**: X-axis completes first, then Y accelerates for final tap
- **Timing Variations**: Randomized acceleration profiles prevent robotic feel
- **Precise Targeting**: Always hits exact letter coordinates despite organic approach

#### Technical Implementation
- **Path Generation**: Linear interpolation with random Y offsets per waypoint
- **Speed Profiles**: Variable feedrates (1200 mm/min lift, 800 approach, 1500 tap)
- **Timing Control**: Configurable settle time (0.5s) and inter-letter pause (1.2s)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful skipping of undefined letters with logging

#### Future Motion Enhancements (Unexplored)
- **Sine Wave Acceleration**: Replace linear speed changes with organic curves
- **Hunting Behavior**: Slight position corrections/adjustments at target
- **Emotional Speed Mapping**: Tie movement speed to message mood categories
- **Approach Angle Variation**: Curved rather than linear approach paths
- **Micro-Movements**: Subtle tail "twitches" while settled on letters
- **Momentum Simulation**: Slight overshoot/correction for realistic physics
- **Fatigue Modeling**: Gradually slower movements during long messages
- **Attention Seeking**: Exaggerated movements when no one is detected

### Message Database (`responses.json`)
Mood-based response system with natural progression:
- **Welcoming**: Initial friendly greetings ("HELLO", "GREETINGS", "WELCOME")
- **Cryptic**: Mysterious oracle responses ("PERHAPS", "WHO KNOWS", "UNCLEAR")
- **Sleepy**: Tired, dismissive messages ("DROWSY", "LATER", "QUIET")
- **Dismissive**: Direct dismissal for overstayers ("GO AWAY", "ENOUGH", "BEGONE")

#### Planned Behavior System
- **Mood Progression**: Automatic escalation based on interaction duration
- **Response Selection**: Randomized within mood categories
- **Timing Thresholds**: Configurable delays between mood transitions
- **Presence Correlation**: Ultrasonic sensor triggers mood state changes

## Raspberry Pi Deployment

### ðŸ”„ NEXT PHASE: Pi Integration
The project is ready for deployment on Raspberry Pi hardware. All core systems have been developed and tested, with the ultrasonic sensor integration providing interactive capabilities.

### Hardware Requirements
- **Raspberry Pi 4** (recommended) or Pi 3B+
- **MicroSD Card**: 32GB+ (Class 10 or better)
- **GPIO Connections**:
  - HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor (TRIG: GPIO 18, ECHO: GPIO 24)
  - USB connection to MKS DLC32 controller
- **Power Supply**: 5V 3A for Pi + controller power requirements
- **Optional**: Voltage divider for ECHO pin (1kÎ© + 2kÎ© resistors)

### Pi Setup Recommendations
1. **Operating System**: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (headless operation)
2. **Python Environment**: Python 3.9+ with virtual environment
3. **Dependencies**: RPi.GPIO, pyserial, pygame (for calibration)
4. **GPIO Permissions**: Add user to gpio group for hardware access
5. **Serial Configuration**: Disable Pi's serial console for USB-serial availability

### Code Adaptations for Pi
- **GPIO Import**: HC-SR04 module uses RPi.GPIO (Pi-specific)
- **Serial Port**: FluidNC connection will use `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`
- **Virtual Environment**: Use `python3 -m venv venv` for isolation
- **Systemd Service**: Consider creating service files for automatic startup
